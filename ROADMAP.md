# BlockMate Roadmap

This document outlines our **high-level goals** and **major milestones**. The roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and evolving project needs.

## 1. Native EduChain Token Service

**Goal**: Provide minimal functionality for creating and managing tokens.

- [x] **Fungible Token Creation** (core attributes only: name, symbol, decimals, supply)
- [x] **Non-Fungible Token Creation** (core attributes only: name, symbol, decimals, supply)
- [x] **Mint Token**
- [x] **Basic Token Transfer** (simple transfer from client to another user)
- [x] **Fetch Token Info** (optional: retrieving metadata)

**Milestone**: `v0.1`

## 2. Swapping on DEXs

**Goal**: Introduce basic token swap functionality.

- [ ] **Swap** a token pair (e.g., EDU for your newly created token)

**Milestone**: `v0.2`

---

## 3. Future Extensions (Ideas)

- **Expanding Token Functionality**: Advanced native token configuration, Token Airdrop APIs
- **EduChain Smart Contract Service**: Functionality via the SDK as well as EVM tooling
- **Security & Governance**: Multi-sig, advanced role-based permissions
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching of network calls, concurrency improvements
- **UI/CLI Tools**: Possibly a CLI to interact with the kit quickly
